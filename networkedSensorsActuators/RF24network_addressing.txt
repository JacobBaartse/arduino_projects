Octal Addressing
Each node must be assigned an 15-bit address by the administrator. This address exactly describes the position of the node within the tree. The address is an octal number. Each digit in the address represents a position in the tree further from the base.

Node 00 is the base node.
Nodes 01-05 are nodes whose parent is the base.
Node 021 is the second child of node 01.
Node 0321 is the third child of node 021, an so on.
The largest node address is 05555, so 3,125 nodes are allowed on a single channel.
