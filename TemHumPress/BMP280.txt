The BME280 (and the BMP280) have two possible I2C addresses depending on how you have the SDO pin configured. 
If SDO is high then the I2C address is 0x77. If SDO is low the I2C address is 0x76.
On the Adafruit BME280 module the SDO pin is pulled high so if you leave it alone the address will be 0x77. 
You can connect SDO to GND to change the address to 0x76.
The Adafruit BME280 library is geared toward their module so it is set up to use a default address of 0x77. 
You can encourage the library to use address 0x76 with [b]bme.begin(0x76)[/b].
